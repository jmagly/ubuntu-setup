# Development Tools

This directory is reserved for development environments and tools, separate from the security toolkit.

## Currently Empty

No development tools are included at this time. This directory structure is maintained for future additions.

## Why Separate?

Development tools are kept separate from security tools because:
- Different use cases and audiences
- Independent update cycles
- May introduce additional attack surface
- Not required for security operations

## Adding Development Tools

When adding development tools in the future:
- Include clear documentation
- Specify security considerations
- List all dependencies
- Provide uninstall instructions
