# Server Security Setup

This directory contains security configurations and scripts specific to server environments.

## Structure
- Place all server-specific scripts in this directory.
- Shared scripts (used by both desktop and server) should go in the `common/` directory at the project root.

## Example Server Features
- Enhanced network security and firewall rules
- Service-specific security configurations (e.g., SSH, web server hardening)
- Server hardening scripts
- Automated backup and monitoring scripts

## Adding New Scripts
- Place new server scripts here and document their purpose and usage in this README or a separate markdown file.

## Usage
Refer to the main project README for general usage. For server-specific scripts, run them from this directory as needed.
